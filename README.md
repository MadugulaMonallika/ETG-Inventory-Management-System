# ETG-Inventory-Management-System
This inventory management system is made with the help of json filehandling concepts

## 1.Intially a json file is used to add stock items into inventory
2.After building complete inventory system we start to use this system to purcahse items, updating the stock and generating biils
3.After each purchase or addition of new items, the inventory is updated
4.Bill is generated after every purchase
5.In sale file all the bills are stored with a unique transcation ID

### The record file consists of 32 products with 5 features per product they are:
1.name
2.price
3.quantity
4.weight
5.category (like food, beauty, home supplies, etc...)

#### The project developed by me does the following things:
1.Adding new items to inventory
2.Purchasing products from inventory
3.Updating the inventory
4.Generating bills
5.All the billing details are stored with unique transaction ID
